# Toucan Toco - Case Study - Data Analyst 


This repository contains all you need to work on the technical test when applying for data analysts positions.

The technical tests consists of following steps below


## 1. Setup your working environment

After cloning or downloading this repository and based on the job offer you applied to, you will need to use one of the following files :

- `Script - Data Analyst.ipynb`
- `Script - Product Data Analyst.ipynb`

The recommended librairies you will need to install in your python environment are in the `requirements.txt` file.


If you are not familiar with python environment and jupyter notebooks, You can use directly the Binder environment [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ToucanToco/data-hiring-case_study-data_analyst_intern/master)  


> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Binder environment take a long time to setup, don't worry and wait a little bit, it needs to install all required ressources and python dependencies.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Binder is also a disposable environment. That's mean if you close your tab and the window, you will lost all your changes.

But If you want still to work locally on your computer, I recommend you to use ressources below after cloning repository.
